# Below shows the basic way of declaring a Variable:

First by using the $ in front of an alphabet:

Example: 
- $a 
- $b

Variables are not case-sensitive in PowerShell, meaning $a is the same as $A

If used in an example:

$A = "ServerTribe" 

$a = "Attune" 

$a will overwrite \$A because it was declared after $A


Another way of declaring Variables is Using the CMDLET [New-Variable], a base syntax is below:

```powershell

New-Variable -Name <variable name> -Value <value>

```

The parameter `-Name` takes in any alphabet or word "string" as the name variable.

The parameter `-Value` takes in any DataType `(String, Array, Int, HashTable)`.

Data Types: This is a classification that dictates what a variable can hold.

PowerShell has several Data Types, a few of them are used in this Blueprint.

Examples of common data types are: 
- String 
- Arrays 
- Int32
- Objects or what we call HashTables.

To check the data type of a variable in PowerShell we make use of the GetTypes() method.

The Example in this Blueprint makes use of the two ways of creating a variable.

Also made use of the GetType() method to get the data type of the variables.

Then we echoed out the Name of the variables declared, the Value and the Data Type.

We made use of the Get-Variable CMDLET and Remove-Variable CMDLET to get all the variables in the session and then delete them. ("code complexity" issues).
