# **POWERSHELL VARIABLES ON ATTUNE**
***This is a Blueprint on Attune on how variables and data type work in PowerShell***
---
> *Variables in PowerShell can store all types of values. For example, it can store the results of commands, expressions like names, paths and values.*
> 
> *Variable names are not case-sensitive, they can include spaces and special characters.*
> 
> *There are different types of variables in PowerShell:*
> 
> - *User-created variables: These are variables that are created and maintained by the user.*
> - *Automatic variables: These are variables that are created by PowerShell. Their values change as required to maintain their accuracy. Users can't change the value of these variables. For example, the _\$PSHOME and $HOST_ variables.*
> - *Preference variables: These variables store user preferences for PowerShell. They are created by PowerShell and are populated with default values _(we won't dive into this)_.*
> 
> *Variables created in the PowerShell command line exist only in the current PowerShell session, when the session is closed all variables are deleted.*
