# Below shows the basic ElseIF statement syntax:

```powershell

if (<test condition 1>)
    {<statement list 1>}
[elseif (<test condition 2>)
    {<statement list 2>}]
[else
    {<statement list 3>}]

```

When an IF statement is run, the <test condition 1> conditional expression is evaluated as either true or false.

If <test condition 1> is true, <statement list 1> runs, and it exits the If statement.

If <test condition 1> is false, the condition specified by the <test condition 2> conditional statement is evaluated.

If <test condition 2> is true, <statement list 2> runs, and it exits the If statement.

If both <test condition 1> and <test condition 2> evaluate to false, the <statement list 3> code block runs, and it exits the If statement.

Multiple ElseIF statements can be used to create a series of conditional tests. Each test is run only if all the previous tests are false. 

To further explain the script in this Attune Blueprint, you can use the ElseIF statement to display a message [Output: (The value 3 is equal to 3.)] when the condition [value of Variable A ($A) is equal to 3] is satisfied.
