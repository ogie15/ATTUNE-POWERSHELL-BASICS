### **Below shows the basic Else statement syntax:**
```powershell
if (<test condition 1>)
    {<statement list 1>}
```
---
> When an IF statement is run, the *<test condition 1>* conditional expression is evaluated as either true or false.
> 
> If *<test condition 1>* is true, *<statement list 1>* runs, and it exits the If statement.
> 
> If *<test condition 1>* is false, *<statement list 1>* does not run, and it exits the If statement.
---
> The IF Statement above in this Attune Blueprint contains a single command and does not contain any Else statements or any ElseIF statements. 
> 
> This is the simplest form of the IF Statement.
> 
> It checks if the condition *[the value of the Variable A ($A) is greater than 3]* is satisfied and echos out the text *[Output: (The value 5 is greater than 3.)]* written in front of the CMDLET *"Write-Host"*.
