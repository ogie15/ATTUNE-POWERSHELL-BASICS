# Below shows the basic Else statement syntax:

```powershell

if (<test condition 1>)
    {<statement list 1>}

```

When an IF statement is run, the <test condition 1> conditional expression is evaluated as either true or false.

If <test condition 1> is true, <statement list 1> runs, and it exits the If statement.

If <test condition 1> is false, <statement list 1> does not run, and it exits the If statement.

The IF Statement above in this Attune Blueprint contains a single command and does not contain any Else statements or any ElseIF statements. 

This is the simplest form of the IF Statement.

It checks if the condition [the value of the Variable A ($A) is greater than 3] is satisfied and echos out the text [Output: (The value 5 is greater than 3.)] written in front of the CMDLET "Write-Host".
