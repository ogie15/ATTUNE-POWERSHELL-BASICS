# Below shows the basic ForEach Syntax:

```powershell

foreach ($<item> in $<collection>){<statement list>}

```

The ForEach Loop statement enclosed in parenthesis represents a variable and a collection to iterate.
  
PowerShell automatically creates the variable ($item) when the loop runs.
 
Before each iteration through the loop, the variable is set to a value in the collection ($collection).
 
The block following a Foreach statement {statement list} contains command(s) to execute against each item in the collection.

In the example in this Attune Blueprint, the first time the Foreach statement runs, it sets the $item variable equal to the first item in $array ("S").
 
Then, it runs the commands ([Write-Host], [Start-Sleep]) in the statement List.
 
The next time the $item is set to "E", and so on till it gets to the last letter in the array "E" then it exits the loop.
 
Then it goes to the last line of the script and runs the CMDLET [Write-Host].
