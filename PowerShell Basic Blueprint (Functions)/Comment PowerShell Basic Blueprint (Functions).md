# POWERSHELL FUNCTIONS ON ATTUNE

This is a Blueprint on Attune of how to work with Functions in PowerShell.

A Function is a list or a group of PowerShell statements that has a name assigned to it.

When a Function is been executed, you type in the Function name and the statements run in the command prompt.

Functions can return values that can be displayed, assigned to variables, or passed to other functions or cmdlets.
