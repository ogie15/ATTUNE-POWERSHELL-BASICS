# Below shows the basic Function syntax:

```powershell

function <function-name> {statements list}

```
## Below shows a basic Function syntax using named parameters:

```powershell

function <function-name> {
    param ($parameter1, $parameter2)
    <statement list>
  }

```

The Function Name (function-name): This is the name of the function been created.

Parameter Section [param ($parameter1, $parameter2)]: This is where any number of named parameters are inputed (this is optional).

The Statement List ({}): This is where all PowerShell commands are been written for the function to execute.

The Example in the Blueprint has two functions (one a basic function and the second a basic function with named parameters).

The Fist Function (FunctionOne) has two commands that write out a welcome message and timestamp of the Server Attune is running on.

When the FunctionOne is called it runs all the commands in the Script Block "{}" (statement list).

The Second Function (FunctionTwo) has named parameters that are assigned default values of the Variables ($FirstVariable & $SecondVariable) which are defined in the script.

When the Function (FunctionTwo) is called it also runs all the commands in the Script Block "{}".
