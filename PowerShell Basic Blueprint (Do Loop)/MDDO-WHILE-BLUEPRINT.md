### **Below shows the basic Else statement syntax:**
```powershell
do {<statement list>} while (<condition>)
```
---
> ##### The Statement List *(\<statement list>)*: This is where all PowerShell commands are been written for the function to execute.
> ##### The condition Section *(\<condition>)*: This evaluates the condition to either True or False; If true the loop continues, If false it breaks out of the loop.
----
> ##### The example in this Blueprint runs the statement list first and then checks the condition *(if the value of the variable "i" is less than total number of strings in the array [$array])*. 
> ##### The loop keeps running until the condition becomes false.
