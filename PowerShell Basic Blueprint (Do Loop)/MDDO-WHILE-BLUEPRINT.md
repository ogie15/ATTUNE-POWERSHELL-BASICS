# Below shows the basic Do While statement syntax:

```powershell

do {<statement list>} while (<condition>)

```

The Statement List (statement list): This is where all PowerShell commands are been written for the function to execute.

The condition Section (condition): This evaluates the condition to either True or False; If true the loop continues, If false it breaks out of the loop.

The example in this Blueprint runs the statement list first and then checks the condition (if the value of the variable "i" is less than total number of strings in the array [$array]).

The loop keeps running until the condition becomes false.
