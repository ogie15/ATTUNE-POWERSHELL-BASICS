# Below shows the basic While statement syntax:

```powershell

while (<condition>){<statement list>}

```

The Statement List (statement list): This is where all PowerShell commands are been written for the function to execute.

The Condition Section (condition>): This evaluates the condition to either True or False; If True the loop continues, if false it breaks out of the loop.

The example in this Blueprint first checks if the condition (the value of the variable "i" is less than the total number of strings in the array [$array]) is true, if true it then runs the commands in the script block (statement list).

The loop keeps running until the condition becomes false.
